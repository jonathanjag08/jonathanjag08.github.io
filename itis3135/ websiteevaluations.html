            <h3>Good Website</h3>
            <a href="https://www.lacoste.com/us/lacoste-heritage.html"> Lacoste Heritage</a>
            <p>Lacoste Heritage is an online shopping site for men's and women's clothing. Additionally, they sell children's clothing. It's divided into 8 sub categories: New In, Clothing, Shoes, Bags and Leather Goods, Accessories, Sport, Underwear, and Sale</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C: The website uses high contrast between text and background, ensuring readability. The bold white text against dark or high-quality images makes information stand out.</li>
                <li>R: Lacoste maintains a consistent color scheme, typography, and branding across the site.
                    The navigation menu, button styles, and font choices are the same throughout, making the browsing experience smooth and cohesive.</li>
                <li>A: Everything on the site is perfectly aligned, from the grid layout of images to the text and call-to-action buttons</li>
                <li>P: Navigation links are logically placed together, making it intuitive to move through the site.
                    White space is used effectively to avoid clutter while still maintaining a premium and elegant feel.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bad Website</h3>
            <a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a>
            <p>Arngren is a website that sells a wide range of products, including clothing, jewelry, accessories, and more. It's language is in Norweigian and difficult to understand without a translator</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C: There is little to no contrast between text and background. Many areas have bright or clashing colors, making the text difficult to read.</li>
                <li>R: There is no consistent design languageâ€”the fonts, colors, and layout styles change unpredictably.
                    Button styles and image formats do not match, making the site feel unstructured and confusing.</li>
                <li>A: Elements are randomly placed all over the page without a clear grid or layout.
                    Text, images, and links overlap or appear scattered, making it extremely difficult to navigate.</li>
                <li>P: Too much information crammed into one space, with no logical grouping of related items.
                    The cluttered nature overwhelms users, making it difficult to distinguish between products, links, and ads.</li>
            </ul>
