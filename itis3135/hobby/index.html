        <p>
            Hello, my name is Jonathan and of Filipino descent. I'm enjoy exercising whether it's playing pick up basketball at the UREC
            or going on the stairmaster. For running, I love going on the Toby Creek Greenway, but my personal 
            favorite is running on the CharlotteRail Trail.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm an avid Marvel that has watched every Marvel movie in the Infiiniy Saga. Additionally, binged every Marvel show
            on Disney+. Besides Avengers: Endgame my other favorite movie is Deadpool and Wolverine. 
        </p>

    <section id="what" class="content-section"> <h3>What</h3>
        <p>
            Exercising is a great way to stay healthy and active. Additionally, exercising involves planning that is structured
            and repetitive, which I like to do. So, with final exams and school work on the rise, I would want to continue
            being structured and planning out so I have adequate time to exercise.  
        </p>

        <p>
            My hobby is exercising. Whether I swim or work out at the UREC, or even run on a trail, I always stay active. 
            For example, I would hop into a pick-up basketball game with my friends and wouldn't even know how much time has passed.
            Next thing I know, we've been playing for 2 hours and I'm already exhausted.
        </p>

    <section id="when" class="content-section"> <h3>When</h3>
        <p>
            I prefer exercise close to the evening because when I do feel exhausted and stressed from completing all my school work,
            excersing helps me relax and when I sweat, I feel better. Additionally, starting last week it has been a goal of mine
            to exercise at least 5 days a week, Monday through Friday. With the temperature rising, it's been easier to where 
            I don't have to constantly bring a change of pants.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also exercise when my sister invites me to run with her on the Charlotte Rail Trail. As my sister lives near the Rail Trail,
            we have access to the trail. My sister is usually my running buddy where we run 2 miles together.
        </p>

    <section id="where" class="content-section"> <h3>Where</h3>
        <p>
            I usually work out at the UREC, but with the temperature rising, I've started to run on the Toby Creek Greenway located near 
            Belk and Miltmore Hall. Then, in the summer I usually run on the Rail Trail located in Uptown as it offers nice views
            as I'm running. Then, if I'm at the beach I usually run along the sand. This past spring break as I went to St. Petersburg
            Beach, I ran close to 4 miles total.
        </p> 

        
        <p>My top three places to exercise:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Charlotte Rail Trail</li>
                <li> Toby Creek Greenway</li>
                <li> UREC</li>

            </ul>

    <section id="how" class="content-section"> <h3>How</h3>
        <p>
            If I'm exercising at the UREC, it's usually one of two things: basketball or stairmaster. If my friends and I schedules
            are opened we usually play a 3-on-3 pick up game that lasts from 1 and half hour to 2 hours. This is a great workout for 
            cardio because I'm always red and sweaty 10-15 minutes into the game and by the end of the game I'm exhausted and could
            hear my heartbeat. But my favorite exercise is the stairmaster. I first started doing it last year when I was a freshman but
            only could do it up to 30 minutes. Overtime I started consistently doing and developed endurance. Now I can go for 45 mintes or
            even for 1 hour. 
        </p>

        <p>
            With spring coming up and temperatures rising, I've started to run on the Toby Creek Greenway located near Belk and Miltmore Hall. 
            Instead of the stairmaster where I'm usually in one area, with running I'm able to actively move outside and get very good cardio in. 
            Since Toby Creek Greenway is long I usually try to run 1-2 miles. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In the summer I usually run on the Rail Trail located in Uptown. Thankfully, as my sister lives near the Rail Trail, we have access to
            the trail. My sister is usually my running buddy where we run 2 miles together. The Rail Trail is different than the Greenway because
            I get amazing views of the Charlotte skyline as I'm running. Sometimes if I'm by myself on the Rail Trail then I try to push myself
            and run 3 miles on it. 
        </p>

    <section id="why" class="content-section"> <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
            I started exercising because ever since I've been a child I've had asthma. My parents put me into several sports as a kid
            like baseball and basketball but I never really got into it until they put me into soccer. I've been playing club soccer from the ages
            5 to 16. Unfortunately I did have to stop club soccer as the dues were too expensive and my older teammates were leaving for college
            so it wouldn't be the same team. Without, that outlet of exercising I would've probably been exercising minimially. But with gyms like
            my local YMCA and the UREC I maximize my time exercising and using its equipment.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also exercise because as my family as had history of health problems I want to break that pattern.
            Back when I was young, instead of my asthma hindering my health, soccer was an outlet for me 
            so I could increase my cardio and prevent health problems later in the future. So, when I had to stop I switched over to running
            or using the stairmaster 3 or even 5 days a week to consistently maintain my cardio.

        <h3>AI Prompts</h3>
        <p>To generate some of the code, including CSS and Javascript, I used ChatGPT. Some of the prompts I typed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can you create a script using CSS and JavaScript that hides all sections except the one clicked in the navbar? 
                When a user selects a section, only that section should be visible while the others remain hidden.</li>
            <li>How can I shorten my fig captions as they are too long?</li>
