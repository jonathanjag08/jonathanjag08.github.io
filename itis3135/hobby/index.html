    <section>What
        <p>
            My hobby is exercising. Whether I swim or work out at the UREC, or even run on a trail, I always stay active. 
            For example, I would hop into a pick-up basketball game with my friends and wouldn't even know how much time has passed.
            Next thing I know, we've been playing for 2 hours and I'm already exhausted.

    <section>When
        <p>
            I prefer exercise close to the evening because when I do feel exhausted and stressed from completing all my school work,
            excersing helps me relax and when I sweat, I feel better. Additionally, starting last week it has been a goal of mine
            to exercise at least 5 days a week, Monday through Friday. With the temperature rising, it's been easier to where 
            I don't have to constantly bring a change of pants.

    <section>Where
        <p>
            I usually work out at the UREC, but with the temperature rising, I've started to run on the Toby Creek Greenway located near 
            Belk and Miltmore Hall. Then, in the summer I usually run on the Rail Trail located in Uptown as it offers nice views
            as I'm running.

    <section>How
        <p>
            If I'm exercising at the UREC, it's usually one of two things: basketball or stairmaster. If my friends and I schedules
            are opened we usually play a 3-on-3 pick up game that lasts from 1 and half hour to 2 hours. This is a great workout for 
            cardio because I'm always red and sweaty 10-15 minutes into the game and by the end of the game I'm exhausted and could
            hear my heartbeat. But my favorite exercise is the stairmaster. I first started doing it last year when I was a freshman but
            only could do it up to 30 minutes. Overtime I started consistently doing and developed endurance. Now I can go for 45 mintes or
            even for 1 hour.

        <p>
            With spring coming up and temperatures rising, I've started to run on the Toby Creek Greenway located near Belk and Miltmore Hall. 
            Instead of the stairmaster where I'm usually in one area, with running I'm able to actively move outside and get very good cardio in. 
            Since Toby Creek Greenway is long I usually try to run 1-2 miles.

        <p>
            In the summer I usually run on the Rail Trail located in Uptown. Thankfully, as my sister lives near the Rail Trail, we have access to
            the trail. My sister is usually my running buddy where we run 2 miles together. The Rail Trail is different than the Greenway because
            I get amazing views of the Charlotte skyline as I'm running. Sometimes if I'm by myself on the Rail Trail then I try to push myself
            and run 3 miles on it.
