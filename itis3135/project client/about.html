        <h2>About Me</h2>  
        <p>Skate Inspiration</p>
        <p>
            <em>Some of my skate inspirations are people like Yuto Horgiome and Collin Provost, and Lizzie Armanto. 
                I really like the Japan Nike SB team in general, 
                due to their style of editing and bag of tricks.</em>

        </p>

        <p>Skate Philosophy</p> 
        <p>
            <em>Honestly its better to attempt a trick immediately than think about the trick itself. 
            Thinking about doing the trick leads to hesitation, 
            and hesitation leads to being scared to actually do the trick itself.</em>
        </p>

        <p>Skate Goals</p> 
        <p>
            <em>I wanna hit a treflip and then get it down consistenly. 
            I want to be able to pop-shuv a three-stair. i want to be able to backside and frontside 180s, 
            and I want to start to look less shaky when doing tricks.</em>
