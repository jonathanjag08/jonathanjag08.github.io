        <h2>About Me</h2>  
        <p>Skate Inspiration</p>
        <em><p>
            Some of my skate inspirations are people like Yuto Horgiome and Yukihiro Takahashi. 
            I really like the Japan Nike SB team in general, 
            due to their style of editing and bag of tricks. 

        </p></em>

        <p>Skate Philosophy</p> 
        <em><p>
            Honestly its better to attempt a trick immediately than think about the trick itself. 
            Thinking about doing the trick leads to hesitation, 
            and hesitation leads to being scared to actually do the trick itself.
        </p></em>

        <p>Skate Goals</p> 
        <em><p>
            I wanna hit a treflip and then get it down consistenly. 
            I want to be able to pop-shuv a three-stair. i want to be able to backside and frontside 180s, 
            and I want to start to look less shaky when doing tricks.
